### About Noot

Noot is a fun yet simple way to record CO2, humidity and temperature values for any location(remote or not, all you need is an internet connection!) with basic and simple-to-assemble off-the-shelf components.

A NootBox is what collects this data, this is a small device that can be placed anywhere. And once set up, will continuously send the data it measures ~every minute to our server.

The data collected from your NootBox is then collected on our server, ready to view at any time. sent to our server and is relayed back to you with a simplistic and easy-to-use dashboard that is packed with features.
Noot is free. Free as in beer, and free as in "free to do what you want with it".
